About ME
======
My name is Tao Huang. I am currently an [assistant professor](https://www.isu.edu/cee/people/faculty/staffdirectoryentries/tao-huang.html) in Water Resources Engineering in the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering at Idaho State University. Before joining Idaho State University, I was a postdoctoral research associate in Earth Systems Data Science at the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL), where my research was focused on quantifying the environmental impacts of conventional hydropower systems on fish species of special concern. This work is accomplished through the application of cutting-edge machine learning and deep learning algorithms, in conjunction with the analysis of datasets collected from advanced autonomous sensor devices. I hold a Ph.D. in Civil Engineering (Hydrology and Hydraulics) from Purdue University. My Ph.D. research topic is about [Quantifying Uncertainty in Flood Modeling Using Bayesian Approaches](https://hammer.purdue.edu/articles/thesis/Quantifying_Uncertainty_in_Flood_Modeling_Using_Bayesian_Approaches/22693543).

Research Interests
======
* Flood modeling (physics-based and data-driven)
* Uncertainty quantification in hydrologic modeling and [flood inundation mapping](https://engineering.purdue.edu/CCE/Media/Impact/2022-Fall/redefining-flood-zones)
