About ME
======
My name is Tao Huang. I am currently a postdoctoral research associate in Earth Systems Data Science at the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL), where my research is focused on quantifying the environmental impacts of conventional hydropower systems on fish species of special concern. This work is accomplished through the application of cutting-edge machine learning and deep learning algorithms, in conjunction with the analysis of datasets collected from advanced autonomous sensor devices. I hold a Ph.D. in Civil Engineering (Hydrology and Hydraulics) from Purdue University.

Research Interests
======
* Flood modeling (physics-based and data-driven)
* Uncertainty quantification in hydrologic modeling
* Data science in Earth systems

Education
======
* Ph.D. in Civil Engineering, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN, 2023
* M.S. in Hydraulic Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, 2014
* B.S. in Hydraulic and Hydropower Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, 2012
